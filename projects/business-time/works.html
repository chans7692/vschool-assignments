                    Where did the knife blade come from?
                    Homo sapiens has been around for about 100,000 years. Surprisingly, he was not the first knife
                    maker. Evidence shows that the recently identified hominid species, Australopithecus garhi, was a
                    tool and knife maker, deliberately selecting and modifying specific raw materials in a sophisticated
                    and consistent way, and with careful intent. He was making double-edged knives about 2.5 million
                    years ago. This technology gave its inventors an astonishing advantage - the ability to shift to an
                    energy-rich, high-fat diet which led to all kinds of evolutionary consequences.

                        "Fossils of Australopithecus garhi are associated with some of the oldest known stone tools,
                        along with animal bones that were cut and broken open with stone tools. It is possible, then,
                        that this species was among the first to make the transition to stone toolmaking and to eating
                        meat and bone marrow from large animals."

                    Millions of years have passed since man first noticed that a sharp flake of obsidian, flint, or
                    agate
                    could cut. No one knows when the birth of the cutting edge took place; it is enough to understand
                    that
                    the knife was man’s first tool, predating modern man (Homo sapiens sapiens). No image, figure or
                    shape
                    would carve his destiny so profoundly, and even today every item and component of everything we
                    touch,
                    eat, wear, or drive has at one time been touched by a cutting edge. We humans, without fang or claw,
                    will always require our essential edge, and are simply naked without it. We are a creature that cuts
                    and
                    shapes things: our food, our clothing, our shelters, our very environment and attitudes are based on
                    our
                    ability to create, and that ability's first and foremost tool is the cutting edge.

                    The origins of the word knife are from the Middle English (450-1150 A.D.) word knif and knyf, from
                    the
                    Anglo Saxon word cnif. Who knows what a knife was called before that? The origin of the word blade
                    is
                    similar, in Middle English it was blad and blade, from the Anglo Saxon word blæd, which means a
                    leaf.

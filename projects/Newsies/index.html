                    <strong><em>PARIS</em></strong>—Saying the devastation could perhaps have been avoided with some
                    routine upgrades to modern
                    200-amp service, investigators announced Wednesday they have traced the cause of the Notre Dame fire
                    to the cathedral’s archaic electrical system, which dates back to the 12th century. “In our
                    examination of the wreckage, we discovered that some of the circuit breakers and sockets hadn’t been
                    updated since the reign of Louis XII,” said lead investigator Jean-Luc Marchand, explaining that
                    many of the fuses from the time of the cathedral’s construction were made of solid oak, while much
                    of the wiring consisted of twisted cords of straw. “The light bulbs we found were so incredibly
                    antiquated that their filaments were made of wool strips dipped in kerosene or whale oil. To make
                    matters worse, Notre Dame’s entire electrical system was hooked into the power company’s transformer
                    on the pole outside with a single strand of hemp twine. It’s a miracle the damage wasn’t worse.”
                    Marchand went on to add that the fire likely started due to a malfunction from one of the rectory’s
                    14th-century wicker space heaters.

                            Study Finds They Just Don’t Make ’Em Like Ginger Rogers Anymore

                        <strong><em>LOS ANGELES</em></strong>—Confirming the widely held theory that, hoo boy, that dame
                        sure is somethin’, a
                        study released Monday by researchers at UCLA found that they just don’t make ‘em like Ginger
                        Rogers anymore. “After an exhaustive five-year survey of thousands of little numbers who may be
                        real firecrackers but ain’t even a patch on Ginger Rogers, we concluded that there’s no two ways
                        about it: That twinkle-toed little pigeon must be the finest damn thing to ever strut her stuff
                        on the silver screen,” said lead author Dr. Alan Grayson, adding that their data suggest God
                        really broke the mold with Ginger Rogers and, moreover, that any square from Delaware would flip
                        his wig seeing them gams of hers in Kitty Foyle. “We found, furthermore, that whether she’s
                        cutting some rug in Swing Time and Flying Down To Rio or breaking hearts in Top Hat, there’s
                        just no game Ginger Rogers can’t ace. In short, Ginger Rogers is a once-in-a-millennium talent
                        and not since Harlow has Hollywood seen a star of her caliber, if you’re pickin’ up what I’m
                        puttin’ down, brother.” Grayson also noted that the survey conclusively proved Fred Astaire was
                        one three-times-lucky sum’bitch.

                            Retiring Rob Gronkowski Admits He’ll Miss Teammates’ Blurry Faces, Fans Spinning Perpetually

                        <strong><em>FOXBORO</em></strong>, MA—In an emotional speech announcing his retirement after a
                        nine-year NFL career with
                        the New England Patriots, Rob Gronkowski reportedly admitted Monday that he’ll miss his
                        teammates’ blurry faces and the fans spinning perpetually in the stands. “It’s really hard to
                        know that I’ll never again stumble off the field, trying to regain my balance while the stadium
                        crowd whirls around me and bright lights hurt my eyes,” said the 29-year-old tight end, adding
                        that he’ll never forget the smell of grass as his head was slammed into the turf by several
                        tacklers or looking up at the dozens of fuzzy, indistinct teammates standing above him waiting
                        for the injury cart to arrive. “I’ll miss the rush of trying to guess which of the 10 balls
                        flying toward me was the one I was supposed to catch, and I’ll definitely pine for the days when
                        I’d arrive at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday in June thinking it was gameday. Mostly, I’ll miss both Tom
                        Bradys, both Bill Belichicks, and both Robert Krafts, who were always there for me, fading in
                        and out of my vision, asking me if I was really in that much pain and if I could suck it up and
                        get back on the field. I’m just thankful I’ll have this constant ringing in my ears to remember
                        my time in the NFL by.” Gronkowski added that he was retiring early in order to enjoy the few
                        years of remembering his career he has left.

                        <strong><em>DENVER</em></strong>—Kicking off his campaign with a promise to order the U.S.
                        military
                        to wipe the sovereign
                        nation off the face of the Earth, presidential candidate John Hickenlooper announced Tuesday his
                        support for using nuclear weapons against Australia just to see if anyone was listening to him.
                        “That’s right—did you hear that? If elected president, I will use our massive thermonuclear
                        arsenal to unrelentingly bombard Australia until it is reduced to a smoking crater,” the former
                        Colorado governor said in a bold effort to gauge whether his candidacy was anywhere close to
                        garnering the kind of media coverage necessary to gain traction in the race for the Democratic
                        nomination. “Let me be perfectly clear: My very first act upon taking the oath of office will be
                        to launch a preemptive and wholly unilateral strike against Australia, employing enough weapons
                        of mass destruction to kill all 25 million of the country’s inhabitants and render the entire
                        continent a toxic, permanently uninhabitable wasteland for thousands of years to come. That’s a
                        promise. Are you all getting this?” Reached for comment, Hickenlooper stated that if his current
                        strategy failed to boost his name recognition in the polls, he would also be willing to endorse
                        government-mandated Bible burnings and legalized pedophilia.

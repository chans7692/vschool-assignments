                    Superman Dead
                </span>
                <p>Superman <strong>"The Man Of Steel"</strong> was found dead late last night after having his cape
                    snagged
                    on a revolving
                    door during a museum heist. Report say that the <em>Super Museum</em> (Home to the largest
                    collection of
                    superman memorabilia in the world) was displaying th largest chunk of Kriptonite ever found at the
                    time of the
                    incident. With his death we as human beings must step back and take stock of things. How fragile
                    life
                    is,
                    how quickly time passes, how we need to appreciate the moments more fully, and how we canâ€™t take
                    anything for granted. We will never forget you Superman, or the tings you have done for us.

                        Daily Star reporter, Clark Kent, went missing early Tuesday night after seen entering a
                        phone-booth.
                        the police are baffled as they say there was no sign that he had ever left. If anyone has seen
                        anything they are asked to contact police inspector Bill Henderson.
